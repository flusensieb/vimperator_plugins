# Description

This is *flusensieb*s repository with vimperator plugins. 

# Installation

Simply copy any plugin (which is nothing more than a javascript-file) to `$HOME/.vimperator/plugin/` and restart your browser.
In case you don't want to restart, you can also `:source ~/foo.js` in vimperator to load the plugin.

## Dependencies

You - obviously - will need a firefox/iceweasel with vimperator. For `tabbar.js` the TreeStyleTab add-on ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/ ) is mandatory.
